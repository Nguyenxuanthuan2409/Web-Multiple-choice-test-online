This is my scientific research work in 2019-2020. The project mainly focuses on Diagnostic knowledge on high school Mathematical knowledge 
domain.
With the main objective of the topic is to help students assess their knowledge, especially the test to graduate Mathematics at the 
national high school exam of Vietnamese students. However, the current programs for multiple training test options in mathematics can only
create an automated test based on parameters of the number of questions, the time, they cannot evaluate the level. 
User-level degrees of understanding. These programs cannot diagnose content a user needs to be improved through testing. On this page, an
intelligent support system for training multiple test options in high school mathematics is developed. This system supports student
training for national graduation examinations. It can create automated tests with user requests. Moreover, this smart system can also
assess the user's knowledge level. It can track users 'research through testing and diagnosing content that they need to improve through
the results of a test. Help students' learning to be improved. and improve the quality of learning, ensuring knowledge is always fully 
and timely cultivated. In addition, the application after finishing will closely connect teachers and students in the school, ensuring 
student learning is seamless.
The project will study the process of building intelligent systems to help students assess their knowledge and drill down to update other
advanced knowledge, ensure the amount of knowledge is constantly updated and meet the needs. study of the students.
The thesis will focus on developing functions such as assessing knowledge for students. Thereby, this intelligent evaluation support
system also helps students know where they are weak, which points need to improve, thereby overcome that lack of control.
